# ColorTail

What does ColorTail do for me?

ColorTail provides a cool way for you to configure how logfiles (or any other files for that matter) look when you tail them.

## Installation

# Install the gem:
    gem install color-tail

## Using ColorTail

By default, ColorTail does absolutely nothing other than just tail a file normally (similar to the trust old unix tool 'tail -f').  But what good what writing a gem be if it just mimiced existing functionality.

## Conifguring ColorTail

Configuring ColorTail is easy.  In your home directory, create a file .colortailrc.  This file will contain a group of arrays similar to the ones laid out in the [example config](http://codaset.com/elubow/color-tail/examples/colortail.rb)
